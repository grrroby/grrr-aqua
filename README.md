grrr-aqua - my personal aquamacs settings

This repository keeps my customize emacs settings for my mac and
includes all extra lisp configuration I have a use for.

It works for me but it is still not perfect.

### Install ###

* Copy all files in the folling folder of your ~/Library

		 ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs\ Emacs/

and you will be ready to go

### List of Plugins ###

Will update later ;-)

### TODO ###

* Ruby - indent is not working great
* Ansible - no settings ;-)
* Delete a whole line with a simple shortcut
* Move lines up and down like Eclipse is doing it (sometimes it works ???)
* ........
